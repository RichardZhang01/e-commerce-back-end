## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to utilize what I've learned about SQL, and integrate that with Sequlize and Express to develop the back-end of an application. 
- I built this project to better understand SQL logic and server-routing.
- This project aims to create the back-end for an application that interacts with a database through Insomnia.
- Through this project, I learned more about SQL, MySQL, Express and server-side development, and the usefulness of Insomnia.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

**Note**: This application requires the use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

To install this project, you first need to clone this repo. To install dependencies, open in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and in the terminal run: 

      npm install 

Alternatively, you can navigate to the application's installation location in [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or similar command-line tool) and do the same.

To create the database, in the terminal start MySQL by running:

      mysql -u <your MySQL username> -p

Then create the database by running:

      source ./db/schema.sql;

`Exit` mySQL, and in the terminal, seed the database by running:

      npm run seed

Before running the app, create a file named `.env` in the main folder with the following lines in the `.env` file:

      DB_USER='<your mySQL username>'
      DB_PW='<your mySQL password>'
      DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'

Replace the DB_USER and DB_PW fields with your credentials.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

Once this project is opened in Visual Studio Code, or navigated to using Git Bash (or similar command-line tool), run: 

      npm start 

The root route for this application is `http://localhost:3001`, but you can change the port number in the `server.js` file.

Open up [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), or similar program, and use the following routes to interact with the database:

- `http://localhost:3001/api/categories`
- `http://localhost:3001/api/tags`
- `http://localhost:3001/api/products`
